Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
==========================================

This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data", available in coursera.

The dataset being used is: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Files

Once you have obtained and unzipped the source files to the working directory, do not change it.The script will load the files from your current working direrctory.

`CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

`run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

The output of the 5th step is called `tidy_average_data.txt`, and uploaded in the course project's form.

##Summary of the steps donwe in the script(run_analysis.R)


*Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
*Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
*Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
*Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
*From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
